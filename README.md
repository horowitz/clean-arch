# clean-arch

This repo contains an example of VIPER using concepts of clean architecture. For this repo i've used part of the code from [Groupin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhorowitz.groupin)

# Features
The app retrieves the user last known location and then searches for restaurants nearby using the Google Places API

# Running locally
To run it locally you should provide your google places API key at `NetworkConfig.kt`
For more information check this link to get your API key 
[Get your key](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key)
